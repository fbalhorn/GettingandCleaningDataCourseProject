The result file tidy_data.txt contains the following variables:

"subject_id": ranging from 1..30 uniquely coding the subject_id
"activity_code": describing the activity to which the data is related out of (WALKING,WALKING_UPSTAIRS,WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS,SITTING,STANDING,LAYING)

The remaining variables were extended by the string "_mean" to reflect the fact, that they have been averaged ofer all matching observations for the respective subject_id and activity_code):
Each of the following variables appears:

'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
